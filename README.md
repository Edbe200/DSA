Sick-Sicker Markov Model: Interactive Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis
An interactive R Shiny application for conducting deterministic sensitivity analysis on a health economic evaluation.
The app implements a Sick-Sicker Markov cohort model comparing treatment strategies (Baseline, Standard Care, and Advanced Therapy) for
a generic disease across five health states (Healthy, Sick Stage 1, Sick Stage 2, Recovery, Death) over 30 annual cycles.
Users can interactively adjust model parameters including utilities, costs, risk ratios, 
discount rates, and willingness-to-pay thresholds to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and visualize results through
tornado diagrams that show which parameters have the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes.
